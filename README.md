# SpotifyHueAndroid
## About
An Android app that connects Spotify to Philips Hue lights for a more immersive listening experience. Changes the color of the lights to the color of the current album art on Spotify.

This project is currently still a work in progress. A majority of the functionality is working, but the interface is far from completion.
